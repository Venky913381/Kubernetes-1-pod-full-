>There are various ways to schedule a pod on node or to select a Node to schedule/execute the pod,
>these are_
      1.Node Name and Node Selector
      2.Node Affinity and Node-Anti-Affinity
      3.Pod Affinity and Pod-Anti-Affinity
      4.Taints and Tolerations


>kubernetes user normally do not need to choose a node to execute their pod, Instead , selection of appropriate
>pod is automatically handled by kubernetes scheduler itself.

>k8s scheduler watches for the newly created pod that have no Node assigned and for every such pod scheduler
>becomes responsible for finding the best node for that pod to run on.

>Automatic node scheduling prevents user from scheduling pod on unhealthy node.
>However, k8s provide the flexibility , to allow user to select the node, so that certain h/w condition 
>like RAM, SSD , Processor etc.. can be fullfilled for execution of certain pod that need such specifications.

>both NodeName and NodeSelector are considered as a Hard scheduling, and both are manual scheduling as we are
>explicitly defining in the pod spec ,the node where we want to schedule the pod.

>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Node Name_

works based on the name of the Node. not based on the labels of the node.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
    name: myapp
spec:
  nodeName: <node_name>     #name of node, NOT LABEL
  containers:
  - name: myapp
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80 
  

>Node name may be the hostname of the node, in cloud environment, hostname will not remain stable and may get 
>changed.

>nodeName is a feild in pod spec, which defines the node name on which we wants pod to get schedule.
>it is simplest way to schedule the pod on perticular node using node selection constraints, but due
>to its limitations it is typically not used.

>we can also assign the pod to master node using this method. this is Hard method/rule to schedule the pod.

>if the named node does not exist in cluster, the pod will not run and in some cases may be automatically deleted.
>like in eks cluster, we do not have choice for selecting node names.

>if the named node does not have a resource to accommodate the pod , the pod will fail.

>node name in cloud environments like eks or gke are not always predictable or stable.

>node have a unique name , while labels can be common among group of nodes.

to get names of the nodes in our k8s cluster.
>kubectl get nodes -o wide

>Node Selector_

works based on the Labels of the Node. not based on the Name of the node.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
    name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp
    image: <Image>
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80

  nodeSelector:
    label: value 

>nodeSelector is a feild in pod spec, which defines the node on which we wants pod to get 
>schedule based on the lables attached to the node.

>it is the simplest form of recommandation for node selection constraint.

>it uses labels to select matching node on to which pod can be scheduled.  if the defined label does not exist
>pod will go in to pending state forever.

>using these method, unlike NodeName, where we have only one node of choice,  it is possible to have choice 
>of having pool of nodes, as we can attach same label to multiple nodes, and scheduler will select any of 
>these node as per availibility.

Assigning label to node_
> kubectl label node <nodename> <label>=<value>
> kubectl label node worker01 size=large

deleting the Node label
> kubectl label node <nodename> <label>-
> kubectl label node worker01 size-

>kubectl get nodes --show-labels -o wide
